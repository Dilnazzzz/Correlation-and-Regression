# Correlation-and-Regression

Video gaming is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. In 2018, a new record of videogame sales was recorded, exceeding the revenue of $43.4 billion worldwide. In the US alone, over 164 million adults play videogames, and three-quarters of the population have at least one gamer in their household. Thus, this report is motivated to explore the increasing popularity of videogames worldwide and evaluate the extent to which the sales in North America can predict global sales variance. Ultimately, using the Video Games Sales data, generated by a scrape of VGChartz, the paper aims to analyze the sales data from more than 16500 games and perform a correlation and regression analysis.
